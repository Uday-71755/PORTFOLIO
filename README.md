### 3.Breast-Cancer-Detection (2024-2024)
Breast cancer detection can be accomplished through the application of various machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Discriminant Analysis
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine

The process begins with loading the dataset and providing a summary of its contents. Subsequently, it is essential to convert the class string values into numerical representations. Following this mapping, the dataset should be divided into features (X) and target labels (Y). The next step involves splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets. Feature scaling is then performed to ensure that all features contribute equally to the outcome. For the training data, the fit method is utilized to compute the mean and variance of each feature, while the transform method is applied to the testing data to adjust the features based on the previously calculated mean and variance. After these preparations, the model scores can be predicted by aggregating the results from all machine learning algorithms, allowing for a comparison of their accuracies through graphical representation. Finally, individual predictions for each machine learning model should be conducted.

### 4.Car-Price-Prediction (2024-2024)
Car Price Prediction analysis utilizing RANDOM FOREST. Initially, we can exclude the car ID from the dataset and proceed to summarize it by defining its shape and providing a description. Subsequently, the dataset can be divided into X and Y, where X comprises all the numerical data present in the dataset, and Y represents the car prices. It is essential to perform scaling due to the significant differences among the numerical values, which can be addressed by normalizing the independent features. Following the scaling process, the dataset can be partitioned into training and testing sets. The training phase will employ the random forest algorithm. Finally, we will assess the model's performance by calculating the R2_Score, which compares the true target values from the test dataset with the predicted values generated by the model. The R2_Score serves as an indicator of how accurately the model's predictions correspond to the actual values.

### 5.Leaf-Species-Detection (2024-2024)
Leaf Iris Species Detection through Decision Tree Algorithm. We will begin by utilizing an iris dataset that includes information about plant leaves, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measured in centimeters. This dataset will allow us to define the shape of the leaves and provide a comprehensive description of the data. Subsequently, we will separate the dataset into input and output variables, followed by dividing it into training and testing sets. Our next step will involve determining the optimal maximum depth value based on the accuracy score and creating a graph to illustrate the relationship between them. Afterward, we will conduct the training process and execute the predictions. Finally, we will assess the model's accuracy based on the predictions obtained.

### 6.Exam-Marks-Prediction (2024-2024)
Prediction of exam scores utilizing Linear Regression. The dataset under consideration comprises 201 rows and 4 columns (hours, age, internet, and marks). Initially, it is essential to eliminate any NA values from the dataset. Following this, the dataset must be divided into input and output variables. Once the segregation is complete, the dataset will be employed to train a Linear Regression model, a type of machine learning algorithm. After the training phase, the model will be used to predict marks based on the variables of hours, age, and internet usage.

### 10.Data Professional Survey Analysis using Power BI(2025-2025)
In this project, I worked with a bulk professional dataset extracted from an Excel file. The data was imported into Power BI, where I performed necessary data cleaning and transformation to ensure data quality for survey analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing inconsistencies.
Once the data was cleaned and structured, I loaded it into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard was designed to extract meaningful insights and provide visualizations that effectively represent the survey data. Key metrics and trends were highlighted through various charts, graphs, and filters, enabling better decision-making and data-driven analysis.This project demonstrates expertise in data preparation, transformation, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI.
